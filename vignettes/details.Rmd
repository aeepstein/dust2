# Influential environment variables and options

`DUST_WORKDIR_ROOT`: an environment variable which sets the **root** working directory for compilation if your code.  Normally, we use the session-specific directory, which is a good choice.  You might want to change this in a few cases:

* You want to generate models from a process and you want these to outlive the lifetime of that process (e.g., for running models on an HPC)
* You want to cache the compilation across sessions

If you set this environment variable, then we'll create models here, each with a name in the pattern `dust_<hash>` where `<hash>` is the hash of the generated code.  This means that if your model changes we'll still recompile it.
